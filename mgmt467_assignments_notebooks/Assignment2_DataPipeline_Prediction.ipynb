    "### Objective\n",
    "Build an automated batch pipeline that ingests weather data, integrates with Citi Bike data, and trains a regression model in BigQuery ML.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Scenario\n",
    "NYC now wants to enrich Citi Bike data with weather and build predictive models to anticipate trip durations. You will create a Cloud Function pipeline, train a model, and document your architecture.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tasks\n",
    "1. Project Setup (GitHub repo + README)\n",
    "2. API Integration (weather API with Python)\n",
    "3. BigQuery ML (regression with 4+ features, evaluate + predict)\n",
    "4. Automated Pipeline (Cloud Function + Scheduler â†’ BigQuery)\n",
    "5. Documentation (Architecture diagram + explanation)\n",
    "6. Predictions (ML.PREDICT on sample data)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Deliverables\n",
    "- GitHub repo with Colab notebook + Cloud Function code.\n",
    "- Notebook with API tests, SQL queries, and evaluation metrics.\n",
    "- Screenshots of Cloud Function logs + BigQuery table.\n",
    "- Brightspace submission: text file with GitHub link + screenshots.\n",
    "\n",
    "### AI Documentation\n",
    "- Document at least 2 Gemini prompts used for debugging or interpreting metrics.\n"
