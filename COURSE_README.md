# MGMT 467: AI-Assisted Big Data Analytics in the Cloud

**Fall 2025**

Welcome to MGMT 467\! This repository is the central hub for all notebooks, code, and resources for the course. Please read this document carefully and refer to the official [syllabus](https://www.google.com/search?q=link_to_your_syllabus.pdf) for detailed policies and grading information.

## üöÄ Course Overview

This course places cutting-edge AI at the heart of big data analysis. We will leverage **Google Colab** for hands-on learning and **Gemini** for AI-powered assistance to tackle real-world data challenges on the **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)**.

Our class operates on a "flipped classroom" model. **Tuesdays** are for exploring new concepts through guided, AI-assisted research, while **Thursdays** are for applying those concepts in hands-on labs within our shared course notebooks.

## üéØ Learning Objectives

By the end of this course, you will be able to:

  - Master 'Prompt Engineering' to effectively interact with Gemini for various data science tasks.
  - Gain knowledge of Cloud Computing, focusing on GCP services like Cloud Storage, BigQuery, and Vertex AI.
  - Apply machine learning techniques (regression, classification) to large datasets using BigQuery ML.
  - Design, build, and automate batch and streaming data pipelines using serverless tools.
  - Articulate the strategic trade-offs of different cloud architectures and data strategies.

## üõ†Ô∏è Core Technologies

This course is built around a modern, cloud-native analytics stack. You will gain hands-on experience with:

  - **Google Cloud Platform (GCP):** The foundation for all our work, including BigQuery, Cloud Functions, and more.
  - **Google Colab:** The interactive notebook environment where we will conduct all our labs and assignments.
  - **Gemini:** Our primary AI assistant for brainstorming, coding, debugging, and analysis.
  - **GitHub:** The version control system we will use to manage and submit all coursework.

## üèÅ Getting Started (Weeks 1-2)

Before diving into the core units, you must complete the following setup tasks:

1.  **Accept Course Invitation:** Join this GitHub organization and get access to the course repositories.
2.  **Activate GCP Account:** Redeem your course credits to activate your Google Cloud Platform account.
3.  **Set Up Budget & Alerts:** Create a budget in GCP to monitor your credit usage. This is a critical step.
4.  **Connect Colab & GCP:** Ensure you can authenticate to your GCP account from within a Google Colab notebook.

## üìö Unit Notebooks & Weekly Schedule

This course is structured into three main units. Each unit has a dedicated, comprehensive Colab notebook that we will build upon week by week.
